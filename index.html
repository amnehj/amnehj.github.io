        <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
        <p>I am a dedicated Mechanical Engineer with a diverse professional background and a passion for innovation. I hold a master’s degree in mechanical engineering with a specialization in Thermal
            Fluid Systems from the Colorado School of Mines, as well as a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering with a focus on Thermal Power from Jordan University of Science and Technology.
            <br><br>
            In my current role as a Research and Development Engineer at Alarko-Carrier, I have performed analysis, defined requirements, and supported aeraulic and thermal testing on fan coil units.
            <br><br>
            I have also developed a model-based component matching system for Direct Expansion (DX) coils. This entailed defining parameters related to coil geometry and operating conditions, conducting
            Python simulations, and finding suitable distributors for each DX coil. Additionally, I have conducted simulations of water coils under various Eurovent test conditions for Fan Coil Units and
            exported summarized Excel reports using Python.
            <br><br>
            During the COVID-19 shutdown, I extended my skills and experience through remote freelance work in the USA. My projects included embedded system programming and mechanical system design. 
            <br><br>
            As a Graduate Student Researcher at the Colorado School of Mines, I delved into building modeling, HVAC, and grid technology. I created multiple building models on OpenStudio, validated 
            them against utility data, and conducted extensive simulations related to vehicle-to-grid technology. My research skills were also used in analyzing chillers and building energy load data, 
            calculating electric and cooling loads, and determining the contribution of different buildings and chillers to the total energy load.
            <br><br>
            Prior to this, I worked as a Mechanical Project Engineer at Dağgaz, where I was involved in designing Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID), managing material lists, and examining 
            tender documents for odorizing and chemical injection systems. I also have valuable experience gained as a Mechanical Engineering Intern at Queen Alia International Airport, which provided
            hands-on HVAC engineering training and exposure to design for manufacturing practices.
            <br><br>
            My diverse professional background, education, and passion for engineering make me an asset for any project or team, and I am excited to take on new challenges and continue making 
            significant contributions to the field of mechanical engineering.
