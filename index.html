        <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
        <p>I am a Mechanical Engineer with a Master’s degree from Colorado School of Mines. Over the past few years, I have worked on a varied set of projects ranging from the thermal modeling of an electric car battery cooling system, the fluid dynamic analysis of a Francis turbine, to designing and programming a balancing robot.<br>
            <br>
            After receiving my bachelor’s degree, I worked at Airport International Group - QAIA as a Mechanical engineer Intern where I received hands on HVAC engineering training. I later worked as a project engineer at Dağgaz where I mainly designed piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&ID) for odorizing and chemical injection systems. <br>
            In 2018, I joined the graduate engineering program at Colorado School of Mines and received a master’s degree in mechanical engineering – thermal fluid systems. Shortly after starting grad school, I began working on analyzing the effect of decentralized residential energy production on grid stability, which relied on running multiple building energy simulations in BeOpt. My research work on energy modeling continued under the supervision of Professor Tabares in his Campus Energy Simulation project that is simulating Mines energy use. I lead OpenStudio model calibration using data from Mines Building Automation System (BAS). In total I improved and calibrated four buildings which expand from dorms (Maple Hall & Weaver Towers), offices (Welcome Center) and mixed-use building type (Elm Hall).<br>
