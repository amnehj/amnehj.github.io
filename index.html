        <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
        <p>I grew up in Jordan and studied Mechanical Engineering at Jordan University of Science & Technology, during my study I worked at Airport International Group - QAIA as a Mechanical engineer Intern where I received hands on HVAC engineering training at the central utility plant in the HVAC unit.<br>
            I later decided I wanted to better position myself in a competitive job market so started my graduate studies at Colorado School of Mines. I have received my M.Sc degree in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in thermal fluid systems.<br>
            As part of my research work for my master’s degree, I worked as a building energy modeler (BEM) for multiple Colorado School of Mines HVAC buildings on OpenStudio using building automation system data and the mechanical drawings. I also analyzed chiller and building energy loads on a central plant loop for multiple buildings to perform a peak load study. I also had working experience as a Mechanical Project Engineer at Dağgaz Gaz Kokulandırma ve Kimyasal Dozajlama.<br>
            Currently, I am working as a Mechanical Engineer Freelancer, my main duties focus on the embedded system programming and mechanical design & analysis for my clients.</p>
